THE APP THAT WE ARE BUILDING IS NOT A GENERAL PURPOSE CHAT APP.
THIS IS A MEDICAL PAGER APP THAT IS MAIN PURPOSE IS TO ALLOW DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL
PERSONALE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, AND TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON
OTHER AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL


================STARTING THE APP
First we want to create a new folder, which we can push to github. 

Then use the terminal to npx create-react-app ./ to create the ap in the current folder.

We can then get rid of the files we dont need like the 'src' folder and create our own.

We the create an index.js in the 'src' folder to make sure we import React,ReactDOM, and App.

Then Use ReactDOM.render and render the App followed by document.getElementbyId('root')
//This pretty much pushes our entire app into the div with the id of 'root' in our premade
html file.

--Component

Thanks to the ES7 Snippet Tool We can use the shortcut 'rafce'
React Arrow Function With Export.

This will create the entire boiler plate code for us. 

================Tips 
[Exporting Multiple Componets]
When Exporting multiple components to avoid cluter in your main App
We use a index.js inside of the components folder and export each component
there

This will allow us to import our componets using {destrcuturing} and we can pretty much 
store multiple imports in one line, avoiding all of the extra clutter.

example : export { default as ChannelContainer } from "./ChannelContainer";




[CSS BEM]
This is a naming combetion for CSS

[React Fragments]
A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements.
Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

You can use {<> </>} the same way you’d use any other element except that it doesn’t support keys or attributes.
